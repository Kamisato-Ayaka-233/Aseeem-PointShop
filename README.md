# Aseeem PointShop

This is a new Garry's mod point shop, I call it "Aseeem PointShop".  

## Featured

It's like the PointShop2.

* Player can buy, sell items and equip, unequip them.
* Support disposable items.
* 3 types of item icons.
* Support player trail now (because it's most easy to create.)
* *Partial* English localization, completed Chinese localization.
* All data save in JSON files.
* Very tiny.

**NOW** it completed basic functions
